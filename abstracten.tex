This thesis is focusing on creating modular documents. One of our goals is to analyse document creation and base on
that proppose application desing for our application.
From this design we will then create web application with separate frontend and backend.
Users will be able to create modules inside repositories, using these modules are users
able to create and generate documents. Both documents and modules support versioning
and thanks to that, we are able to generate even older versions of our documents.
At the end we tests our solution and evaluate it. We also propose new features that could
be implemented in the future.
